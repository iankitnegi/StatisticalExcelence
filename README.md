Welcome to StatisticalExcelence! This repository is dedicated to sharing my learning journey in statistics as it applies to data science. Here, you'll find notes, code snippets, and resources that I find useful. Let's dive into the world of data together and uncover statistical insights!

## What are Statistics?  
Numerical facts like: Percentages, averages, probability…  
Examples:  
•	5% of the people who took the CPA exam earned a score of 90 or above.  
•	The average cost for a Toyota Camry last year was $23,000.  
•	The probability that you will get a six when you roll a die is 1/6 or 0.167.  

Def: “Statistics is the art and science of collecting, analysing, presenting and interpreting data to help make informed decisions.”  
Definition for data analysis: Raw Data => Use Statistical Methods => Useful information for Decision Makers

## Types of Statistics:  
### Descriptive Statistics:  
Raw Data that is summarized and presented  
•	Tabular: Table of information  
•	Graphical: Charts and Graphs  
•	Numerical: Like an average (mean) or proportion  

### Inferential Statistics: 
•	The process of using data obtained from a sample to make estimates and test hypotheses about the characteristics/attribute of a population.  
•	Take a sample from the population and draw reasonable conclusions that can help to estimate the unknown future.

### Important Terms:  
Population: The set of all elements of interest in a particular study (In many situations it is too costly to get data from all the elements in the population) Example => Census: Collecting data for a population  
Sample: A subset of the population. Example => Sample survey: Collecting data for a sample
